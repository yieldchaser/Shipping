> *"I am a Man of Fortune, and I must seek my Fortune."*  
> — Henry Avery, 1694

A fully automated, zero-infrastructure shipping freight intelligence platform. Tracks Baltic freight indices, shipping ETF holdings, and a proprietary dry bulk composite — surfaced through a multi-tab analytical dashboard built entirely in a single `index.html` file.

**No server. No build step. No cost.**

## Live Dashboard

Served directly from this repository via GitHub Pages.  
Open `index.html` in any browser, or visit the GitHub Pages URL.

## How It Works (Self-Sustaining)

The system runs entirely on its own via two GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow | Schedule | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `daily_update.yml` | **2 PM + 7 PM UTC daily** | Scrapes all 6 Baltic indices from stockq.org, deduplicates by date, appends new rows, commits `*_historical.csv` |
| `etf_holdings_update.yml` | **2 PM UTC Mon–Fri** | Downloads the master Amplify ETF holdings CSV, extracts BDRY and BWET, sorts by vessel class → contract month, commits `*_holdings.csv` |

Both workflows are **idempotent** — safe to re-run at any time. Duplicate rows are deduplicated by date before writing. Both workflows pull the latest remote state before running to prevent push conflicts.

The dashboard itself fetches everything client-side at page load — no backend, no API keys, no secrets required by the browser.

## What This Tracks

### Freight Indices — 6 series, daily since Dec 2007

| File | Index | Code | Vessel / Cargo |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bdiy_historical.csv` | Baltic Dry Index | BDI | Headline dry bulk composite |
| `cape_historical.csv` | Baltic Capesize Index | BCI | 180,000 DWT — iron ore, coal |
| `panama_historical.csv` | Baltic Panamax Index | BPI | 82,000 DWT — grain, coal |
| `suprama_historical.csv` | Baltic Supramax Index | BSI | 58,000 DWT — minor bulk |
| `cleantanker_historical.csv` | Baltic Clean Tanker Index | BCTI | Refined products |
| `dirtytanker_historical.csv` | Baltic Dirty Tanker Index | BDTI | Crude oil |

CSV schema: `Date (DD-MM-YYYY), Index, % Change`

### BDRY Spot Composite — 7th product, computed client-side

Replicates the **Solactive Breakwave Dry Freight Futures Index** methodology using daily spot values:

```
BDRY_Spot(t) = 0.50 × BCI(t) + 0.40 × BPI(t) + 0.10 × BSI(t)
```

Available from October 2008 (~4,200 data points). Computed in the browser on every page load from the three existing CSVs — no extra file. Selectable as a 7th product across all tabs. Useful for comparing against the BDRY ETF market price to monitor premium/discount to spot.

### ETF Holdings — updated each market day

| File | ETF | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `bdry_holdings.csv` | Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF (BDRY) | Capesize 5TC, Panamax 5TC, Supramax 58 FFA futures — front 5 months |
| `bwet_holdings.csv` | Breakwave Tanker Shipping ETF (BWET) | TD3C (MEG→China 270kt VLCC) and TD20 (WAF→Continent 130kt Suezmax) FFA futures |

CSV schema: `Name, Ticker, CUSIP, Lots, Price, Market_Value, Weightings`

BDRY index weights: **50% Capesize, 40% Panamax, 10% Supramax** (Solactive ISIN DE000SLA4BY3).  
BWET index weights: **90% TD3C, 10% TD20** (Solactive ISIN DE000SL0HLG3, Excess Return).

### 🏦 ETFs

#### BDRY & BWET Card Layout (identical structure for both)

Each card contains:
1. **Live price + day change** — Yahoo Finance v8 API via CORS proxy; NAV populated from the same response (`meta.navPrice`)
2. **Metrics row 1:** Total Futures · Collateral Cash · Futures/AUM %
3. **Metrics row 2:** NAV · Expense Ratio (3.50%) · Leverage = (Total Exposure / Cash) − 1 expressed as %
4. **Holdings table** — FFA contracts sorted by vessel class → expiry month (nearest first). Scrollable, fixed-height.
5. **Futures Allocation donut** — normalised to 100% of futures notional (cash excluded)
6. **Trade route map** — with inline legend (exporting nations / importing nations / routes / BWET focused routes)
7. **Fundamentals / Data Sources** — sector-specific data links:
   - BDRY: China Steel & Bulk Demand + Export Flow Indicators (macromicro.me)
   - BWET: Crude & Product Demand (Trading Economics, EIA) + Key Trade Routes (TradingView: TD3C / TD20)
8. **Market Outlook & Research Sources** — Athenia S.A. · Breakwave Advisors · BIMCO · Amplify ETFs official page

#### BDRY Liquidity Tracker *(below the ETF cards)*

Position-sizing model applied to BDRY's full daily history (~1,994 days), fetched live from Yahoo Finance:

| Column | Formula |
|---|---|
| Dollar Value Traded | `Close × Volume` |
| Tier % | Vol < 50K → 2% · < 100K → 3.5% · < 500K → 5% · ≥ 500K → 6.5% |
| Possible Shares | `floor(Volume × Tier%)` |
| Safe Liquidity | `Possible Shares × Close` |

- **KPI strip** — today's values for all fields
- **Safe Liquidity chart** — historical $ tradeable per day
- **Volume chart** — daily bars coloured by tier, with 50K / 100K / 500K threshold lines
- **Rolling Averages chart** — 7 windows (10D / 20D / 1M / 3M / 6M / 12M / 24M)
- **Full data table** — all rows newest-first, scrollable, CSV export, window toggle (1Y / 3Y / All)

---

## Automation Details

### `update_indices.py`

- Scrapes `en.stockq.org` for all 6 Baltic indices
- `raise_for_status()` on every HTTP response — fails loudly on 4xx/5xx
- Sanity-checks scraped values (skips zero or negative index readings)
- Deduplicates by parsed date (chronological sort, not lexicographic)
- Idempotent — re-running never corrupts existing data

### `update_etf_holdings.py`

- Downloads the master Amplify ETF holdings CSV from `amplifyetfs.com`
- Filters to BDRY and BWET
- Sorts by vessel class → contract month (nearest expiry first)
- Index-reset before sort to prevent merge misalignment on filtered DataFrames
- Validates `Market_Value` as numeric before any arithmetic
- Idempotent — overwrites the output file each run

### GitHub Actions Schedules

| Workflow | Cron | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `daily_update.yml` | `0 14,19 * * *` | Runs at 2 PM UTC (2 hrs after BDI ~12:00 UTC publish) and 7 PM UTC |
| `etf_holdings_update.yml` | `0 14 * * 1-5` | Runs at 2 PM UTC Mon–Fri after Amplify publishes updated holdings |

Both workflows: pull latest before running (prevents push conflicts on concurrent runs), use explicit file paths for `git add` (prevents staging unintended files), include `GITHUB_TOKEN` in checkout for write access.

---

## Running Scrapers Locally

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas lxml

python update_indices.py        # update all 6 Baltic indices
python update_etf_holdings.py   # update BDRY and BWET holdings
```

Both scripts are safe to re-run at any time.

## Notes

- CSV dates are in `DD-MM-YYYY` format
- BDI history starts **December 2007** — tail end of the commodity supercycle peak (~10,000+)
- BDRY Spot Composite starts **October 2008** (earliest date all three dry bulk components overlap)
- Tanker index histories: BCTI from Jan 2008, BDTI from Dec 2007
- The FFA term structure chart is only as fresh as the last `bdry_holdings.csv` / `bwet_holdings.csv` commit — check the commit timestamp to confirm
- `Shipping_Main.xlsm` is an offline Excel workbook for ad-hoc analysis consuming the same CSV data
- Capesize went briefly negative in 2020; the yearly Range % uses `(max−min)/avg` rather than `(max−min)/min` to avoid nonsensical outputs in such years
